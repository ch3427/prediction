# Prediction

Prediction of student behavior has been a prominant area of research in learning analytics and a major concern for higher education institutions and ed tech companies alike. It is the bedrock of [methodology within the world of cognitive tutors](https://solaresearch.org/hla-17/hla17-chapter5/) and these methods have been exported to other areas within the education technology landscape. The ability to predict what a student is likely to do in the future so that interventions can be tailored to them has seen major growth and investment, [though implementation is non-trivial and expensive](https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/policy-papers/promise-and-peril-predictive-analytics-higher-education/). Although some institutions, such as [Purdue University](https://www.itap.purdue.edu/learning/tools/forecast.html), have seen success we are yet to see widespread adoption of these approaches as they tend to be highly institution specific and require very concrete outcomes to be useful. 

In this project, I build models to predict student course dropout and then comparing those models:
* Construct classification models to predict student dropout and state validation metrics for the model
* Compare classification models on appropriate metrics
